## Description
This project is a new practical item of my mobile app series that made with:
 - react native v0.65.1
 - [the-movie-database-api](https://www.themoviedb.org/) - (to fetch movies and casting data)
 - [@react-navigation/stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/) - (to screen transitions)
 - [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient) - (custom linear background)
 - [react-native-image-colors](https://github.com/osamaqarem/react-native-image-colors) - (to read colors from a movie image)
 - Of course, I used things like custom hooks, components, helpers and context API. 

## You'll need a TMDB (The Movie Database) account to access API service
Don't forget this 'cause I don't provide my api_key for this public project.
  - [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

### To access API fetch: 
- Go to API folder and open movieDB.tsx
- Add your TMDB api_key
- Change the language if you need it
- Go to movieDB.http with your api_key to test requests 

## Available Scripts
